        <p class="last-updated">Last updated: January 29, 2024</p>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Welcome to Ramble. We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal data.
            This privacy policy will inform you about how we handle your personal data when you use our app
            and tell you about your privacy rights.
        </p>

        <h2>Information We Collect</h2>

        <h3>Audio Recordings</h3>
        <p>
            When you record audio in Ramble, your recordings are processed using OpenAI's Whisper API for transcription.
            Audio files are temporarily stored on your device during processing and are sent to OpenAI's servers for transcription.
            We do not permanently store your audio files on our servers.
        </p>

        <h3>Notes and Transcripts</h3>
        <p>
            All notes, transcripts, and related data are stored locally on your device using SwiftData.
            We do not sync, backup, or store your notes on our servers unless you explicitly choose to export them.
        </p>

        <h3>Usage Analytics</h3>
        <p>
